## 🔍 Expected Conflicts & Resolution

### Issue: Conflicts in `src/App.tsx`

If you encounter a conflict marker like:
```jsx
<<<<<<< HEAD
// Your current main branch code
=======
// Our feature branch code
>>>>>>> feat-auth-bypass-IY9Ng
```

**Resolution**: The `src/App.tsx` file should **NOT** have conflicts because it was only touched minimally. If conflicts appear:

### Solution 1: Keep Both (Recommended)
```javascript
// Keep the exact current version from HEAD (main branch)
// The feature changes don't modify App.tsx routing
```

### Solution 2: Manual Merge
If conflicts occur in App.tsx, follow this priority:
1. ✅ Keep all import statements from both versions
2. ✅ Keep the `BYPASS_AUTH` constant as-is
3. ✅ Keep all routes unchanged
4. ✅ Keep auth providers unchanged

### Safe Merge Commands:

```bash
# Option A: Accept their version (main branch)
git checkout --ours src/App.tsx

# Option B: Accept our version (feature branch)
git checkout --theirs src/App.tsx

# Option C: Manual - After resolving, stage it
git add src/App.tsx
```

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step PR Merge Process

### Step 1: Create Pull Request

### Step 2: Check for Conflicts
GitHub will automatically detect if there are conflicts. If shown:

### Step 3: Resolve Conflicts (if any)
```bash
# Fetch latest main
git fetch origin main

# Merge main into feature branch locally
git merge origin/main

# If conflicts occur in files:
# Edit the file to resolve markers
# Then:
git add <conflicted-file>
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts"
git push origin feat-auth-bypass-IY9Ng
```

## 📝 Merge Conflict Reference

### Common Conflict Patterns:

**Pattern 1**: Import Statement Conflict
```jsx
<<<<<<< HEAD
import { Circles } from './pages/Circles'; // old version
=======
import { Circles } from './pages/Circles'; // new with fixes
>>>>>>> feat-auth-bypass-IY9Ng

// Resolution: Keep only one import (they're identical)
import { Circles } from './pages/Circles';
```

**Pattern 2**: Route Definition Conflict
```jsx
<<<<<<< HEAD
<Route path="circles" element={<Circles />} />
=======
<Route path="circles" element={<Circles />} /> // same
>>>>>>> feat-auth-bypass-IY9Ng

// Resolution: Keep one
<Route path="circles" element={<Circles />} />
```

**Pattern 3**: Component Changed
```jsx
<<<<<<< HEAD
<Circles /> // old
=======
<Circles /> // new with fixes
>>>>>>> feat-auth-bypass-IY9Ng

// Resolution: Keep new version
<Circles /> // new with fixes
```
